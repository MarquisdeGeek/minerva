The Minerva API

A typical query will be in the form:

http://domain/minerva/api/tv.php?cmd=status&fmt=text&user=xxx&pass=xxx&fmt=xml

Provided you have access to the api directory of your Minerva install, 
everything should work normally. If you can only access Minerva through SSL
you will need to modify the query to begin,

http://secureUser:securePass@domain/minerva/... etc ...

Where the secure pass/user combination is as specified normally in the 
dialog boxes that appear.

The 'fmt' (format) argument determines how the result will be presented. By
default, this is XML, but can also be 'text' (plain text) and 'json' (for 
JSON).

The user/pass is prepared with:

   minuser pass [username] set [newpassword]

Only a valid Linux system user can change passwords.


There are three sets of permissions necessary for a specific user to
control Minerva through the API:

1. rw access to the API conduit. Set this with:

   minuser auth [username] set api rw

2. read access to the conduit applicable to the command itself. So, to 
   review the status of the TV (api/tv.php) that user must have the read
   permission for tv.

3. Write access to the same conduit for those commands which change the state
   of the conduit. In the TV example, this would involve changing the channel.


Examples

For the sake of brevity, the main URL component (along with user/pass and 
format parameters) shall be omitted.
