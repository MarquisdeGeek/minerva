# NOTE: This doesn't use finddev because it does no work itself, but
# uses the code of others. This allows the script to be called with
# 'bedroom' or 'lounge' and the individual scripts (mixer/say) can
# use the appropriate devices for that room. (This is necessary since
# there are many devices involved, and no single $DEVICE could handle
# them all.)
