Minerva is a complete, easy to use, home automation suite. Using Minerva you 
can make your home easier and cheaper to run and more secure. With Minerva 
you can: switch on your lights from anywhere, using a mobile phone or PC; 
email your video; check your security CCTV footage; control your central 
heating and much more.

This package contains everything neccesary to use the web components of 
Minerva. You will additionally need to install:

Apache
PHP

Some applets require additional utilities,

Heyu (http://www.heyu.org/) for X10 control and/or RF gateway support (Cosmic)
xsltproc (for the TV guide)
cdcd (for the CD player)
mpg123 or mplayer, mp3tool (for the MP3 player)
mySQL (for Moonbeam - the bookmark manager)

Installation is not difficult, but exacting. The install script should
"just work" provided you don't change the paths! Minerva installs components
to,

   /usr/local/minerva
   /var/log/minerva

and the WARP web components to,

   /var/www/minerva
