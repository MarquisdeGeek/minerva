You will now need to make sure that the web server (www-data) has access
to,

* the CD-ROM if you intend to control it via the web. 
* the serial port (/dev/ttyS0) if you intend to control heyu via the web

So either add www-data to the minerva group and restart the web server, 
or place the devices themselves into the Minerva group.

usermod -G minerva -a www-data

Repeat this for any of Linux users you want to be able to control Minerva.

If you are using Cosmic, you will need to update /etc/heyu/x10.conf
and run 

   heyu restart 
   heyu engine

If you are wanting the TV guide, please add
55  8  *   *   *      ~minerva/update/tv/daily_process.sh
to your crontab.

If you are wanting weather updates, please add
0   5  *   *   *     ~minerva/update/weather
to your crontab.

You might also want to set the password to the 'minerva' user to something
usable.
